# Design System Guidelines

## Overview
- This document outlines the usage of the [Your Design System Name] design system.
- The goal is to ensure consistency, accessibility, and efficiency in UI development.
- Always refer to the canonical design system documentation/library for the most up-to-date components and patterns. [Link to Design System Documentation/Library if available]

## Core Principles
- **Consistency:** Use established components and patterns uniformly across the product.
- **Reusability:** Leverage existing components instead of creating custom solutions for common UI needs.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure implementations adhere to accessibility standards defined in `accessibility-standards` rule.
- **Efficiency:** Utilize the design system to accelerate the design and development process.

## Usage

### Components
- Use components directly from the established library ([Specify Library, e.g., Figma library, React component library]).
- Do not modify core component styles or behaviors unless contributing back to the system via the established process.
- Use components according to their documented API and intended use cases.

### Tokens & Styles
- **Colors:** Use predefined color tokens for UI elements, text, backgrounds, borders, etc. Do not use hardcoded hex values.
- **Typography:** Apply predefined text styles (font family, size, weight, line height) for headings, body text, labels, etc.
- **Spacing & Layout:** Use defined spacing units/tokens for margins, padding, and layout grids.
- **Iconography:** Utilize icons from the approved icon set/library.

### Patterns
- Follow established patterns for common interactions and layouts (e.g., forms, navigation, data display, feedback messages).
