## Formatting
Title case = Sentence case

## Key Content Principles

- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in formatting, capitalization (Sentence case), number representation, punctuation, and acronym usage, following the primary style guides. Define acronyms clearly on first use.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure grammatical correctness and proper punctuation.
- **Procedural Clarity:** Structure instructions and procedures logically for easy understanding.
