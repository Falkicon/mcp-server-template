Current State of the Art for Creating Model Context Protocol ServersThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a pivotal open standard designed to streamline the integration of artificial intelligence applications with external data sources and tools.1 By providing a universal language for AI systems to interact with diverse resources, MCP aims to overcome the limitations of fragmented, custom integrations, fostering a more interconnected and scalable AI ecosystem.3 This report examines the current state of the art for creating MCP servers easily and consistently, exploring best practices, available libraries, frameworks, and tools that facilitate this process.Understanding the Model Context ProtocolAt its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture, where a host application, such as an AI assistant or an integrated development environment (IDE), manages one or more clients that connect to MCP servers.3 These servers act as intermediaries, exposing specific capabilities like accessing files, databases, or APIs in a standardized manner.6 The protocol facilitates the exchange of information through defined primitives: tools, which are functions that AI models can execute; resources, which provide data and content to the models; and prompts, which are reusable templates guiding model behavior.4 This structured approach allows AI applications to leverage external knowledge and perform actions beyond their inherent capabilities.10The communication between clients and servers typically occurs over standard input/output (stdio) for local integrations or via HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for remote access.3 The protocol emphasizes security by maintaining clear boundaries between the AI and external tools, with servers receiving only the necessary context for their specific tasks.3 This design ensures that sensitive information remains protected and that user authorization is required for certain actions.3Best Practices for Setting Up and Managing MCP ServersEstablishing and maintaining robust MCP servers requires adherence to several key best practices, particularly concerning security, data handling, and operational efficiency.14Security is paramount, necessitating the implementation of appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms, especially for remote connections.10 Validating all inputs against defined schemas, such as those created with libraries like zod, is crucial to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.14 For network transport, using TLS encryption is recommended, particularly for SSE, and sensitive data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.14 Implementing access controls for resources, validating resource paths, and monitoring resource usage are also vital security measures.14Effective error handling is another critical aspect of MCP server management.14 Employing a consistent error handling strategy, such as the Result pattern, and avoiding the leakage of sensitive information in error messages are important considerations.14 Logging security-relevant errors and implementing proper cleanup after errors contribute to a more secure and stable server.14General best practices include following the principle of least privilege, implementing defense in depth, conducting regular security audits, and diligently managing dependencies to address potential vulnerabilities.14 For local communication, using the stdio transport is often more efficient and avoids network-related security concerns.14 Thorough documentation of the server's security measures and expected behavior is essential for maintainability and trust.14Libraries and Frameworks for Simplified Server CreationThe development of MCP servers is significantly eased by the availability of official Software Development Kits (SDKs) and higher-level frameworks.18 Anthropic, the originator of MCP, provides SDKs for several popular programming languages, including Python and TypeScript, which are actively maintained and well-documented.7 These SDKs handle the underlying protocol complexities, allowing developers to focus on the specific functionalities of their servers.12The Python SDK, for instance, offers the FastMCP framework, which simplifies server development by leveraging Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions.5 This approach reduces the amount of boilerplate code required and enhances code readability.20 Similarly, the TypeScript SDK provides a structured way to define servers, resources, tools, and prompts with strong type safety, often utilizing libraries like zod for schema validation.12Beyond Python and TypeScript, SDKs are also available for other languages like Java, Kotlin, and C#, demonstrating the growing adoption and community support for MCP across different technology stacks.4 The C# SDK, developed in collaboration with Microsoft, simplifies the creation of both MCP servers and clients within the.NET ecosystem.18 The existence of these multi-language SDKs makes MCP accessible to a wider range of developers, regardless of their preferred programming language.18 Additionally, community-driven libraries might exist to further simplify specific aspects of MCP server development, although these would require further investigation beyond the provided materials.Automation of Deployment and ConfigurationAutomating the deployment and configuration of MCP servers is crucial for ensuring consistency, reducing manual errors, and improving overall efficiency.28 Several strategies and tools can be employed to achieve this.Scripting tools, such as Bash or Python scripts, can automate common tasks like starting and stopping servers, setting up initial configurations, and performing routine maintenance.15 This approach can streamline repetitive operations and ensure a degree of consistency in server management.Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines represents a more advanced level of automation.28 By utilizing tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions, the entire process of building, testing, and deploying MCP servers can be automated. This ensures that any updates or new features are delivered rapidly and reliably, following a consistent and repeatable workflow.Containerization with Docker for Consistency and PortabilityDocker has become an indispensable tool for creating consistent and portable environments for software applications, and MCP servers are no exception.19 Docker enables the packaging of an MCP server along with all its dependencies into a container, guaranteeing that the server will run consistently across any system that supports Docker.19 This eliminates environment-specific issues and simplifies the deployment process significantly.19The process involves writing a Dockerfile, which defines the environment for the MCP server, including the base operating system image, necessary dependencies, and the commands to start the server.15 Once the Dockerfile is created, Docker can build a container image, which can then be tagged and pushed to container registries like Docker Hub or private registries for easy sharing and distribution.19 For more complex deployments involving multiple containers, Docker Compose can be used to define and manage multi-container applications, such as an MCP server alongside a database.28 Running an MCP server from a Docker image is straightforward, often involving a simple docker run command with appropriate port and environment variable configurations.19Configuration Management for MCP ServersManaging the configuration of MCP servers effectively is essential for adapting them to different environments and ensuring proper operation.27 Several techniques and tools are available for this purpose.The use of environment variables is a widely adopted best practice for configuring MCP servers, particularly for sensitive information like API keys and tokens.15 This approach prevents hardcoding sensitive data within the application code and allows for easy modification of configurations based on the deployment environment.Configuration files, typically in JSON or YAML format, are also commonly used to manage server settings.21 Many MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop and Cursor, rely on JSON configuration files to define and manage the MCP servers they connect to.21 This standardization facilitates the sharing and deployment of server configurations across different client applications.For managing MCP server configurations at scale, dedicated configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet can be employed.28 These tools allow for the automation of configuration tasks, ensuring consistency across multiple server instances and simplifying administration in large deployments.Furthermore, specific tools tailored to MCP configuration management have emerged. MCP Manager is a desktop application designed to simplify the management of MCP servers for Claude Desktop, providing a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and managing server configurations.33 Similarly, the mcp command-line tool offers functionalities for creating server scaffolds, managing server aliases, and configuring MCP settings for various IDEs and LLM applications.34 Another tool, mcp-client-configuration-server, focuses on managing configuration files for different MCP clients on macOS and Windows systems, enabling programmatic retrieval, listing, addition, and removal of server configurations.30Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Consistent EnvironmentsInfrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, bringing the benefits of version control, repeatability, and automation to infrastructure management.16 This approach is highly applicable to MCP server deployments, ensuring consistent and reproducible environments.Popular IaC tools like Terraform and CloudFormation can be used to define the underlying infrastructure required to run MCP servers, such as virtual machines, networking configurations, and storage resources.16 By codifying the infrastructure, developers can easily provision and manage their MCP server environments, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring consistency across different deployments.Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure provide their own IaC services that can be used to manage the infrastructure for MCP servers hosted on their platforms.28 Additionally, platforms like Cloudflare Workers offer a serverless environment specifically designed for deploying remote MCP servers.16 Cloudflare Workers allow developers to deploy MCP server logic as serverless functions, leveraging Cloudflare's global network for scalability and performance.16 This approach simplifies deployment and management, particularly for making MCP servers accessible over the internet to a wider audience.16Comparing Methods and Tools for MCP Server Creation and ManagementThe landscape of MCP server creation and management offers a variety of methods and tools, each with its own strengths and considerations regarding ease of use, consistency, and scalability.

The comparison between local and remote MCP server deployments reveals a significant trend towards remote hosting. Local servers, often utilizing stdio transport, are well-suited for development and specific use cases requiring direct access to local resources.17 However, remote deployments on platforms like Cloudflare, leveraging SSE or the emerging Streamable HTTP, address the limitations of local hosting by providing internet accessibility, built-in authentication mechanisms like OAuth, and scalable infrastructure capable of handling a wider range of users and applications.16 This shift towards remote servers expands the potential of MCP beyond developer-centric tools to more everyday consumer use cases and enterprise-level applications.16Conclusion and Future DirectionsCreating and managing MCP servers easily and consistently is becoming increasingly feasible due to the advancements in SDKs, frameworks, and automation tools. Developers can leverage language-specific SDKs like those for Python, TypeScript, and C# to abstract away the complexities of the MCP protocol. Frameworks such as FastMCP further simplify the development process, particularly in Python.For ensuring consistency and portability, containerization with Docker has proven to be a highly effective solution. Automation of deployment and configuration through scripting and CI/CD pipelines contributes to increased efficiency and reliability. Various configuration management tools, including environment variables, configuration files, and dedicated utilities like MCP Manager and the mcp CLI, offer different levels of control and convenience for managing server settings. Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform and CloudFormation, along with serverless platforms like Cloudflare Workers, enable the provisioning and management of consistent and scalable infrastructure for MCP servers.The choice of tools and approaches depends on the specific project requirements, team expertise, and desired level of scalability. For local development and integrations, SDKs and Docker might suffice. For larger-scale deployments and broader accessibility, especially in enterprise environments, IaC tools, dedicated configuration management solutions, and remote server platforms like Cloudflare Workers are becoming increasingly important.The future of MCP server creation appears promising, with the increasing involvement of major industry players like OpenAI signaling a strong endorsement of the protocol.4 This growing ecosystem is likely to lead to further standardization, enhanced tooling, and wider adoption of MCP across a diverse range of AI applications and platforms, ultimately making it easier and more consistent to integrate AI with the vast landscape of external data and capabilities.
